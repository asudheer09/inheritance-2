inheritance: inheritance is the process by which one object can acquire the properties of another object.
 advanatge: code reusabilty.
 how to achieve this inheritence is using extends keyword.
 example:
  class A{
  //data
  //methods
  
  }
  
  class B extends A{
  
  // A data+ A methods
  
  // B data
  
  // B methods
 
 }

 Inheritance types :
 1. single 
 2. mulit-level
 3. multiple
 4. hierarichal
 5. hybrid
 
 1. another name for inheritance is called is -a relationship.
 
 class Pet{
 
 }
 
 class Dog extends Pet{ }
 
 class Cat extends Pet{ }
 
 Dog is a Pet
 Cat is a Pet
 
  1. single : If a class can extend only one parent class is called single inheritance.
  
  A
  |
  B
  
  class A {
  
  }
  
  class B extends A{
  
  }
  
 2. mulit-level 
 
	A
	|
	B
	|
	C
 
 3. multiple inheritance
 
 if  a class can exend more than one class at a time then its called multiple inheritance.
 
   A     B
   |____|
       |
	   C
Java doesnot support multiple inheritance. 

A ---> method1()
B ---> method1()
 class C exends A,B{
	main(){
	 C c= new C();
	  c.method1(); //ambiguity for compile which class method to call 
	}
 }
 we cant achieve multiple inheritance in java through classes.
 But we can achieve through interfaces.
 In Java a Class cannot extend multiple classes.if we extend so will get compile time error.
 
 Hierarichal Inheritance:
			A
	____|____
	|		|		|
	B     C      D
	 
 Only one parent class will be there using that we can create any no of child classes.
 
 Hybrid Inheritance: It is a combination of single and multiple inheritance.
 
   __A__
   |        | 
   |		|  
   B      C
   |____|
       |
	   D
  
  Polymorphism:
  poly= many
  morphism=forms
  one task can be perfromed in different ways.
  
  2 types of polymorphisms:
  1. compiletime (overloading)
  2. runtime (overriding)
  
  overloading
  ==========
  writing multiple methods with the same name with in the same class  but  with different arguements.
